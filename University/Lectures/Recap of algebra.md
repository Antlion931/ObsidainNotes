![[commutative ring]]

## Couple of [[commutative ring]] that are useful
- $\mathbb{Z} = (\mathbb{Z}, +, \times)$, There is a bit of inaccuracy, because $\mathbb{Z}$ represents both, integer number, and ring from integer number with addition and multiplication
- $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$, same as previous one.
- [[Gaussian integers]]
- [[dual numbers]]
- [[ring Zn]]
