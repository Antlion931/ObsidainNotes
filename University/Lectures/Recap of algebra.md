![[commutative ring]]

## Couple of [[commutative ring]] that are useful
- $\mathbb{Z} = (\mathbb{Z}, +, \times)$, There is a bit of inaccuracy, because $\mathbb{Z}$ represents both, integer number, and ring from integer number with addition and multiplication
- $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$, same as previous one.
- [[Gaussian integers]]
- [[dual numbers]]
- [[ring Zn]]

## Polynomials over [[field]]

Let's say we have $K$, which is a [[field]]. We can make [[integral domain]] of polynomials with coefficients from $K$. We will call them $K[x]$.

## [[invertible element]]

In [[Gaussian integers]] $\{1, -1, i, -i\}$

In Polynomials over [[field]], only constants are [[invertible element]].

$x^{-1} = 1/x$
