# Lectures
During lectures we will answer questions like, why, what and how in the world of embedded systems. We will talk about components, communication between them and how to organise work with them.

# Labs
During laboratories we will slowly build up an Arduino car with different sensors and other similar things.

# Project
In the meanwhile in group we will work on a project. Which is a documentation for embedded system of our choice, construction of it is not required, tough. We will need to find components that are used to construct this system, and also write a lot of UML diagrams showing different use cases of it.
