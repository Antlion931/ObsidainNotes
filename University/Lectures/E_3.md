### Simplex

### Half duplex
Communication such that, **Rx** and **Tx** are interchangeable, and this communication work in both ways. But only one device can transmit data at a time.

### Full duplex
Communication such that, **Rx** and **Tx** are interchangeable, and this communication work in both ways, and both devices can communicate at the same time.
