## Questions
- Could [[SMTP]] be encrypted?
  In it self, no. But we can add layer like [[TSL]].
- By using [[TSL]] can we be sure, that nobody can read our mails?
  No, your email provider can also see it context.
- What to do, to ensure a security?
  We can send a encrypted message, So even a server can not read it's context. We could also digitally sign your mails to make sure that nobody changed anything.
- What is different in ProtonMail?
  It has a lot of features to make you more secure, for example, 
  - when you are sending mail between protonmails, they are encrypted, so protonmail doesn't know about what we are mailing.
  - We can use some password to communicate with mails outside of protonmail ecosystem
  - It uses [[TSL]] in other cases
  - We can connect to ProtonMail using Tor, so they don't even know your [[IP]].
  - They store our every mail, in a way that only a user can read them.
