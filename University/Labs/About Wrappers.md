## Notes
- Make documentation for every library, with examples and edge cases
- For every language use some build tool, like cmake or cargo
- Every exercise is composed of two implementations, so just make two libraries with one testing code.

- [ ] #todo write gcd and function to resolve diophantine equation in C
