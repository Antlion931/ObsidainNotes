**N**ear **F**ield **C**ommunication is a standard based on [[rfid]] technology. I have range up to 10 cm and uses electromagnetic field of 13,56 MHz with addional carrier fields next to the main.

## Example
![[nfc_found_in_gym.jpg]]
In an image we can see a [[nfc]] sticker, a passive device that will only work near active device, it is compose of 2 main elements:
- antena, the spirial of silver wire around, is a coil, that is used to power up cpu, recieve data and send it, altough it is small, too small for the wave lenght, it works fine, because communication is based on change of current cause by change in magneticfield, casue by for example some transistor shortening a wire.
- cpu, a black dot at the inner line of spiral, is a simple machine, that will send data stored in cpu after starting working, however it can be more compicated, credit cards encript data, generate tokens making it much safer. Noteworthy is that clock sognal is also send by antena.
## Notes
- Some cards types can be readed and writed a lot of times.
- two active devices can also communicate via [[nfc]]
- it is slow, but very quiclly establis connection with other device
