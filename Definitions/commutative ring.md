$(R, +, \times)$ is [[commutative ring]] when:
1. $(R, +, \times)$ is [[ring]].
2. $\times$ is [[commutative]].

## Example
- $(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is a [[commutative ring]].
- $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$ (read as matrices of size 2x2 with real number as elements) with normal addition and multiplication of matrices, is not an [[commutative ring]], because multiplication of matrices is not [[commutative]].
