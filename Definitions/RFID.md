**R**adio **F**requency **Id**endentyfication is a technology used to identify devices with radio. One of the biggest things that can be made with it is a device that won't need a battery to work. And will take power from active device that is trying to read data.
## Example
One of the most simple devices that uses [[RFID]] is called 1 bit transponder. It stores 1 bit of information, either it is near or not. To make it work we need Transmitter, the active part, is constantly making field that alternates in some range. The receiver and transponder which is an antenna with a resistor.

Every antena have it resonant frequency, so when a transmiter makes an alternating field, and the transponder is near. It will make a change in received field, as it resonates.

That is how theft protection works in shops. The transponders are on valuable products.

And near exit there are receivers/transmitters

However this technology can be more complicated. This is a warning in a locker room that reads:

> In the Interest of our Clients, 
> 
> Our products contains electronic protection from thieves. 
> 
> Locker room are equipped with monitoring systems. Removing of security tag will cause alarm to ring.
>
> Police will be informed about every theft.
