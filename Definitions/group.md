$(X, +)$ is a group when $X$ is not empty and
1. $x,y \in X \implies x + y \in X$. 
2. $+$ is [[associative]].
3. There is an [[identity element]].
4. every element has it [[inverse element]].

You can also think about it as a set of elements and function that takes two arguments and returns some element of that set.


## Examples
- $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ - real numbers with normal addition
- $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ is not an [[group]] because [[inverse element]] of $3$ in addition is $-3 \notin \mathbb{N}$
- time on clock
