#book

Is an environment in which application may run. Multiple programs at once can use a single [[terminal]], but only one can be at foreground. All programs can modify a text buffer. Keyboard and mouse information is send only to foreground program. 

Similarity with input and output. By default **stdout** and **stderr** are revived by [[terminal]], and **stdin** is only send to foreground program.

One of the basics application that uses [[terminal]] is [[interpreter]].
