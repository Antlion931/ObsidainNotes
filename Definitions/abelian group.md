Also called **commutative group**, is a [[group]] $(X, +)$ where:
1. $+$ is [[commutative]].
2. $+$ is [[associative]].
3. There is an [[identity element]].
4. every element has it [[inverse element]].
## Examples
- $(\mathbb{R}_+, /)$ positive real numbers with division aren't an [[abelian group]] because $\frac{1}{3} \ne \frac{3}{1}$
- $(\mathbb{N}, +)$ is not an [[abelian group]] because [[inverse element]] of $3$ in addition is $-3 \notin \mathbb{N}$
- $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ [[identity element]] is $0$, and [[inverse element]] for $x$ is $-x$
