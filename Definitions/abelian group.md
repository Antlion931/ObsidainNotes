Also called **commutative group**, is a [[group]] $(X, +)$ where:
1. $+$ is [[commutative]].

## Examples
- $(\mathbb{R}_+, /)$ positive real numbers with division aren't an [[abelian group]] because $\frac{1}{3} \ne \frac{3}{1}$
- $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ [[identity element]] is $0$, and [[inverse element]] for $x$ is $-x$
